ScratchOrgSeedingScript: Contains Apex classes that I wrote for seeding new scratch edition Salesforce orgs with the data necessary to begin developing against the latest version of Master branch right away. For further ease of use, I also wrote a bash file which authenticates against Conquer's back end, spins up a scratch org, pushes the code base to the org, and seeds the org with the afore described data.

The bash file is configured so that it only runs in the context of a .SFDX project, specifically in a directory called "~../packages/conquer". It is not intended for use outside of Conquer, and is included here simply as a sample of work I have personally performed.
